        <h1>Tiramisu from Tokoj</h1>

        <p>Tiramisu from Tokoj is a wonderful delicacy. Everyone likes it and it doesn't take too much time to make it (if you don't count the 12 hours it has to spend in the fridge before eating).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>25 dkgs of mascarpone</li>
        <li>30-35 lady fingers (savoyardi)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of powdered sugar</li>
        <li>Cocoa (from this decade)</li>
        <li>Rum aroma</li>
        <li>A big cup of coffee</li>

      </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Brew the coffee - let it cool - add rum roma to it when it's cooler</li>
        <li>Whisk the mascarpone with the powdered sugar - adding the sugar through a szita slowly - until it gets super creamy.</li>
        <li>Separate the egg yolk from the whites. Whites go to a separate bowl - yolks go to the mascarpone one by one (still whisking slowly).</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg whites to a foam (add pipika salt and sugar to it before whisking, so the foam will be "harder").</li>
        <li>Mix the foam and the mascarpone cream slowly - avoid crushing the foam by whisking it together too quickly.</li>
        <li>Layer the lady fingers and the cream in your container. Use a szita to add cocoa on the top layer.</li>
        <li>Let it rest for around 12 hours in the fridge before eating.</li>

      </ol>
